<h1>I'm sorry ??</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, due to lack of time and <a href='img/infp.jpg'>motivation</a>, <b>this year's Fools Event might be underwhelming as a result</b>. A lot of things happened - I am now working at Microsoft, preparing a talk for a huge international cybersec conference, and planning to move to a different country. All of these things prevented me from properly working on Fools2023.</p>

<p>As a consequence, there is no fancy Pok&eacute;mon save file, and the event is essentially a glorified CTF, <i>purely</i> focusing on hacking challenges and requiring high technical prowess. With that, <b>I am offering sincere apologies to the non-technical part of my audience</b>.</p>

<p>There will be no introductory video posted on my channel, since the event is targeted only for technical audiences, who will find this site and spread it anyways. To make up for it, I'll put focus on making an actual real video, which is in the works.</p>

<p>Obviously, I had very big plans for Fools2023 - however, I had to make the painful decision of delaying them. A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is bad forever. <b>Hopefully, on the next year, you will be able to get the full April Fools experience, with both the technical and non-technical crowds being able to participate</b>.</p>
